## How It Works

The system coordinates data flow between multiple services to create seamless, compassionate conversations:

### Phone Call Flow
```
1. Twilio receives incoming call ‚Üí WebSocket connection established
2. Audio streams to Deepgram ‚Üí Real-time speech-to-text
3. GPT processes text ‚Üí Generates compassionate response with memory context
4. Response chunks sent to Deepgram ‚Üí Text-to-speech conversion
5. Audio streams back to caller ‚Üí Natural conversation flow
```

### Key Technical Features
- **Interruption Handling**: Users can interrupt the AI naturally, just like human conversation
- **Response Chunking**: Uses bullet points (‚Ä¢) to break responses into quick audio chunks
- **Memory Integration**: Persistent SQLite database stores personal details across calls
- **Emotional Analysis**: GPT-4 analyzes conversation tone and emotional patterns
- **Emergency Detection**: Intelligent assessment of genuine emergencies vs. anxiety episodes

## Conversation Design Philosophy

The AI companion follows specific conversational principles:

### Core Personality Traits
- **Infinitely Patient**: Never shows frustration with repetition or confusion
- **Validating**: Acknowledges feelings rather than correcting misunderstandings
- **Gentle**: Uses soft, comforting language appropriate for elderly users
- **Consistent**: Maintains the same warm personality across all interactions

### Response Patterns
```javascript
// Example compassionate response structure
"Hello dear! ‚Ä¢ How are you feeling today? ‚Ä¢ I'm so glad you called."
```

The `‚Ä¢` symbol is crucial - it breaks responses into natural chunks for faster audio delivery, reducing user wait time during anxious moments.

### Memory System
The AI silently remembers important details:
- Personal preferences and family information
- Medical concerns and medication schedules
- Emotional patterns and effective comfort strategies
- Topics that bring joy or cause distress

**Important**: Memory operations are invisible to users - the AI never mentions "remembering" or "storing" information.

## Available AI Functions

The AI companion has access to specialized functions that enhance the caregiving experience:

### Emergency Assessment (`transferCallDeferred`)
**Purpose**: Evaluate whether a situation requires immediate human intervention
**Critical Note**: The system understands that users with dementia often experience anxiety that feels like emergencies. True emergencies are rare.

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Actual medical distress (chest pain, difficulty breathing)
- Physical injury from falls
- Genuine safety concerns

**Default Behavior**: Comfort and redirect rather than transfer, as most "emergencies" are anxiety episodes.

### Engagement Tool (`getNewsHeadlines`)
**Purpose**: Redirect anxious or repetitive conversations with novel topics
**Categories**: General news, health, science, entertainment
**Usage**: Proactively introduced when conversations become circular or distressing

### Memory Functions (Silent Operation)
- `rememberInformation`: Store personal details naturally during conversation
- `recallMemory`: Retrieve stored information for context
- `updateMemory`: Build progressive understanding over time
- `forgetMemory`: Remove outdated or incorrect information
- `listAvailableMemories`: Internal discovery of stored memories

**Critical**: These functions operate silently - the AI never tells users it's "remembering" or "storing" information.

### Call Management (`endCallDeferred`)
**Purpose**: Gracefully end conversations when appropriate
**Behavior**: Always includes warm goodbye before triggering end sequence

## Adding Custom Functions

To extend the AI's capabilities:

1. **Create Function File**: Add `newFunction.js` in `/functions/` directory
2. **Define in Manifest**: Add function definition to `function-manifest.js`
3. **Include Speech Cue**: Add `say` property for pre-execution comfort phrases

Example function structure:
```javascript
// functions/comfortUser.js
module.exports = function comfortUser(args) {
  // Function logic here
  return "Comfort message delivered successfully";
};
```

Function manifest entry:
```javascript
{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "comfortUser",
    say: "Let me help you feel better.",
    description: "Provide targeted comfort for specific anxiety triggers",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        trigger: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The anxiety trigger to address"
        }
      },
      required: ["trigger"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing
```bash
npm test
```
Runs Jest tests for all function modules, ensuring reliability without requiring GPT calls.

### Integration Testing Scripts
```bash
npm run inbound   # Automated test call with scripted conversation
npm run outbound  # Places call to YOUR_NUMBER for manual testing
npm run chat      # Text-based testing with full system integration
```

### Admin Dashboard Testing
```bash
npm run test:dashboard
```
Tests the admin interface APIs and statistics endpoints.

## Data Management Tools

### Call Removal Script
For administrative purposes, you can safely remove specific calls and their associated data from the system:

```bash
# Remove call by call_sid (exact or partial match)
node scripts/remove-call.js CA123456

# Remove call by conversation ID
node scripts/remove-call.js --id 42

# Preview what would be deleted (dry run)
node scripts/remove-call.js CA123456 --dry-run

# Force deletion without confirmation prompt
node scripts/remove-call.js CA123456 --force
```

**What gets removed:**
- The conversation record
- All messages in the conversation
- All summaries for the conversation
- All analytics data for the conversation
- All emotional metrics for the conversation

**What is preserved:**
- Memories (shared across all calls)
- Other conversations and their data
- System settings and configuration

The script includes safety features:
- Interactive confirmation before deletion
- Detailed preview of what will be removed
- Transaction-based deletion for data integrity
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Database Cleanup Scripts
```bash
# Remove conversations shorter than 1 second
node scripts/cleanup-short-conversations.js

# Preview cleanup without making changes
node scripts/cleanup-short-conversations.js --dry-run
```

## Database & Persistence

The system uses SQLite for reliable local storage with automatic schema migrations:

### Stored Data
- **Conversations**: Call metadata, duration, emotional analysis
- **Messages**: Complete conversation transcripts with timestamps
- **Memories**: Personal information learned about users
- **Analytics**: Emotional patterns and conversation insights
- **Settings**: System configuration and preferences

### Emotional Analysis
Advanced GPT-4 powered analysis tracks:
- Anxiety levels (0-10 scale)
- Confusion indicators
- Agitation patterns
- Overall mood sentiment (-10 to +10)
- Comfort effectiveness metrics

### Data Privacy
- No personally identifiable information in logs
- Local SQLite storage - no external transmission
- Conversation summaries rather than full transcripts
- HIPAA-conscious design for healthcare environments
