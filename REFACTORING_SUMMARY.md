# SQLite Storage Refactoring - Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored the codebase to completely remove JSON storage support and make SQLite the sole storage mechanism.

## Changes Made

### 1. Files Deleted
- ✅ `services/storage-service.js` - Removed JSON storage implementation
- ✅ `test/storage-service.test.js` - Removed JSON storage tests
- ✅ `test/storage-integration.test.js` - Removed dual-mode integration tests

### 2. Files Modified

#### app.js
- Removed `StorageService` import
- Removed `createStorageService()` factory function
- Removed `STORAGE_MODE` environment variable check
- Now directly instantiates `SqliteStorageService` with `DatabaseManager`

#### .env.example
- Removed `STORAGE_MODE` configuration option
- Updated comments to reflect SQLite-only storage

#### test/sqlite-storage-service.test.js
- Updated test descriptions to remove "API compatibility" references
- Tests now focus on SQLite functionality only

#### tasks.md
- Updated documentation to reflect SQLite as the only storage option
- Removed references to JSON storage migration

### 3. Verification Results
- ✅ All JSON storage files removed
- ✅ No references to `STORAGE_MODE` remain
- ✅ No imports of old `StorageService` remain
- ✅ SQLite storage tests pass (16/16 tests passing)
- ✅ Application uses SQLite directly without feature flags

## Technical Impact

### Benefits
1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single storage implementation reduces complexity
2. **Better Performance**: SQLite provides faster queries than JSON file system
3. **Data Integrity**: ACID transactions ensure data consistency
4. **Concurrent Access**: Built-in safety for multiple processes
5. **Rich Queries**: SQL capabilities for advanced analytics

### Storage API
The storage service now provides these methods:
- `saveSummary(summary)` - Save conversation summary to database
- `loadSummary(conversationId)` - Load specific summary
- `listSummariesForDate(date)` - Get summaries for a date
- `generateWeeklyReport(startDate)` - Generate weekly analytics

## Database Configuration
- Default path: `./conversation-summaries.db`
- Configurable via: `SQLITE_DB_PATH` environment variable
- Database is created automatically on first use
- Uses WAL mode for better concurrent access

## Next Steps
The refactoring is complete and the application is ready to use SQLite exclusively for all storage needs. No further migration or cleanup is required.
