# Assets Directory

This directory contains images, icons, and other static assets for the admin interface.

## Structure

- `/icons/` - SVG icons and favicon files
- `/images/` - Screenshots, backgrounds, and other images
- `/fonts/` - Custom font files (if needed)

## Guidelines

- Use SVG icons when possible for better scalability
- Optimize images for web (WebP format recommended)
- Follow naming convention: kebab-case for consistency
- Include alt text descriptions for accessibility

## Icon Usage

Most icons are inline SVG for better performance and theming support. Custom icons should be added here if needed.

## Image Optimization

All images should be optimized for web:
- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Compress images appropriately
- Provide multiple sizes for responsive images
- Include proper alt attributes for accessibility
